# AssettoCorsaTelemetryApp

A simple WPF app to give you telemetry from Assetto Corsa. Just press start when you want to start and it will create graphs like this:

The performance impact is minimal, I have a pretty poor machine and I don't lose more than 10 FPS. The graphs are made with this library: https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot

In theory this should work in Assetto Corsa Competizione, however I don't own the game so I haven't tried.
